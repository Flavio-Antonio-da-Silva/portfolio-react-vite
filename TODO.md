# Future Code Changes Guidelines

1. **Documentation Reference**:
   - Always refer to the [Tailwind CSS 4.1.11 documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for any new utility classes, components, or configurations.

2. **Component Updates**:
   - When updating or creating new components, ensure that Tailwind's utility classes are used effectively for styling.

3. **Dark Mode Handling**:
   - Continue to utilize Tailwind's dark mode features as demonstrated in the `App.jsx` file.

4. **Testing**:
   - After implementing changes, test the components to ensure they render correctly in both light and dark modes.
